- Extracts a dataset containing the activityID, subjectID, mean and standard deviation values
- Labels all the columns with their respective feature names
- Replaces the activity ID with the activity name for readability
- Creates a second dataset with average values of each feature for each activity for each subject
- Save the final dataset into a .txt file
